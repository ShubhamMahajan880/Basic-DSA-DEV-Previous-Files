# Basic-DSA-DEV-Previous-Files

This repository contains my early learning files from **DSA** and **Web Development**.
I started this repo to keep track of my fundamentals, practice code, and all the small concepts I revised while building a strong base in both domains.

These are the files I wrote while learning, experimenting, breaking things, and improving step by step.
